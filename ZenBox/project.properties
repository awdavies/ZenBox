# This is meant to be ignored, but is necessary for getting the project up and running.

# Make sure never to explicitly commit this to git, as this is only necessary for building
# the project.  The only other line needed (but not included), is the path to the OpenCV 
# library project, which can be set up with eclipse.  The OpenCV library is not included as
# it could be anywhere on a respective user's computer.
